        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting
        you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
        about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
        stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
        DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
        DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
        online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
        inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
        Notice.

      <p className="text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser
        DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal
        standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to
        them at this time.
