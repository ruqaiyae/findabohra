          Google Maps uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell towers to estimate your
          location. GPS is accurate to about 20 meters, while Wi-Fi and cell
          towers help improve accuracy when GPS signals are weak, like indoors.
          This data helps Google Maps provide directions, but it is not always
          perfectly precise. The Google Maps Platform APIs that we use store and
          access cookies and other information on your devices. If you are a
          user currently in the European Economic Area (EU countries, Iceland,
