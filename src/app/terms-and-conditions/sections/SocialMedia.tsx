        As part of the functionality of the Services, you may link your account
        with online accounts you have with third-party service providers (each
        such account, a &quot;Third-Party Account&quot;) by either: (1)
        providing your Third-Party Account login information through the
        Services; or (2) allowing us to access your Third-Party Account, as is
        permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use
        of each Third-Party Account. You represent and warrant that you are
        entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to us
        and/or grant us access to your Third-Party Account, without breach by
        you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the
        applicable Third-Party Account, and without obligating us to pay any
        fees or making us subject to any usage limitations imposed by the
        third-party service provider of the Third-Party Account. By granting us
        access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that (1) we may
        access, make available, and store (if applicable) any content that you
        have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account (the
        &quot;Social Network Content&quot;) so that it is available on and
        through the Services via your account, including without limitation any
        friend lists and (2) we may submit to and receive from your Third-Party
        Account additional information to the extent you are notified when you
        link your account with the Third-Party Account. Depending on the
        Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that
        you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable
        information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts may be available
        on and through your account on the Services. Please note that if a
        Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or our
        access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party
        service provider, then Social Network Content may no longer be available
        on and through the Services. You will have the ability to disable the
        connection between your account on the Services and your Third-Party
        Accounts at any time. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
        THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS
        IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE
        PROVIDERS. We make no effort to review any Social Network Content for
        any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality, or
        non-infringement, and we are not responsible for any Social Network
        Content. You acknowledge and agree that we may access your email address
        book associated with a Third-Party Account and your contacts list stored
        on your mobile device or tablet computer solely for purposes of
        identifying and informing you of those contacts who have also registered
        to use the Services. You can deactivate the connection between the
        Services and your Third-Party Account by contacting us using the contact
        information below or through your account settings (if applicable). We
        will attempt to delete any information stored on our servers that was
        obtained through such Third-Party Account, except the username and
        profile picture that become associated with your account.
