        abusive, racist, offensive, or hate language; (3) your reviews should
        not contain discriminatory references based on religion, race, gender,
        national origin, age, marital status, sexual orientation, or disability;
        (4) your reviews should not contain references to illegal activity; (5)
        you should not be affiliated with competitors if posting negative

        We may accept, reject, or remove reviews in our sole discretion. We have
        absolutely no obligation to screen reviews or to delete reviews, even if
        anyone considers reviews objectionable or inaccurate. Reviews are not
        endorsed by us, and do not necessarily represent our opinions or the
        views of any of our affiliates or partners. We do not assume liability
        for any review or for any claims, liabilities, or losses resulting from
        any review. By posting a review, you hereby grant to us a perpetual,
